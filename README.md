# movie-review-sentiment-analysis
POC of ML implementation for sentiment analysis of IMDB reviews using Stochastic Gradient Descent

This is a proof-of-concept of a problem solved using Machine Learning techniques. We perform sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews to classify them as positive or negative reviews.

Based on an algorithm from Sebastian Raschka's Python Machine Learning book using SciKit and NTLK.

The directory *webapp* contains a flask based application that uses the trained classifier to make predictions and provide feedback for improving the classifier. The app is publicly hosted at http://rohitnayak.pythonanywhere.com

The provided IPython notebook contains some key code snippets that illustrate the concepts of this ML project.
